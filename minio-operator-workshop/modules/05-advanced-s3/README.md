## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand and implement official MinIO multipart uploads
- Work with object metadata using official S3-compatible features
- Implement official object lifecycle management
- Use advanced official S3 API features like presigned URLs
- Optimize upload/download performance using official MinIO capabilities

## üìö Key Concepts

### Official Multipart Upload
MinIO's official implementation automatically uses multipart upload for files larger than 64MB, following AWS S3 specifications for better performance, reliability, and the ability to resume interrupted uploads.

### Official Object Metadata
Custom metadata in MinIO follows official S3 standards, allowing you to store additional information with objects for application-specific data, content management, and automation.

### Official Storage Classes
MinIO supports official S3-compatible storage classes for cost optimization and performance tuning.

## üìã Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Test Environment (Official Setup)

```bash
# Ensure official MinIO client is configured and port forwarding is active
mc admin info minio-official

# Create a bucket for advanced testing using official commands
mc mb minio-official/advanced-features

# Create test files of different sizes for official testing
echo "Small file content" > small-file.txt
dd if=/dev/zero of=medium-file.dat bs=1M count=10
dd if=/dev/zero of=large-file.dat bs=1M count=100
```

### Step 2: Understanding Official Multipart Uploads

```bash
# Upload small file (single part) using official method
time mc cp small-file.txt minio-official/advanced-features/

# Upload medium file (may use multipart) using official method
time mc cp medium-file.dat minio-official/advanced-features/

# Upload large file (definitely uses multipart) using official method
time mc cp large-file.dat minio-official/advanced-features/

# Check upload details using official stat command
mc stat minio-official/advanced-features/small-file.txt
mc stat minio-official/advanced-features/large-file.dat
```

### Step 3: Working with Official Object Metadata

```bash
# Upload file with custom metadata using official attr parameter
mc cp small-file.txt minio-official/advanced-features/metadata-example.txt \
  --attr "Content-Type=text/plain,Author=Workshop-User,Department=Engineering,Version=1.0,Environment=Development"

# View object metadata using official stat command
mc stat minio-official/advanced-features/metadata-example.txt

# Upload with different content types using official method
echo '{"name": "test", "value": 123}' > test.json
mc cp test.json minio-official/advanced-features/ \
  --attr "Content-Type=application/json,API-Version=v1"

# Upload binary file with metadata using official method
mc cp medium-file.dat minio-official/advanced-features/binary-with-metadata.dat \
  --attr "Content-Type=application/octet-stream,Purpose=Testing,Size-Category=Medium"

# List all objects with their metadata
mc ls minio-official/advanced-features/
```

### Step 4: Official Advanced Copy Operations

```bash
# Copy with metadata preservation using official method
mc cp minio-official/advanced-features/metadata-example.txt minio-official/advanced-features/copied-with-metadata.txt

# Copy with metadata modification using official method
mc cp minio-official/advanced-features/metadata-example.txt minio-official/advanced-features/modified-metadata.txt \
  --attr "Version=2.0,Status=Modified"

# Server-side copy (efficient for large files) using official method
mc cp minio-official/advanced-features/large-file.dat minio-official/advanced-features/server-side-copy.dat

# Compare copy performance using official methods
time mc cp minio-official/advanced-features/large-file.dat /tmp/local-copy.dat
time mc cp minio-official/advanced-features/large-file.dat minio-official/advanced-features/server-copy.dat
```

### Step 5: Working with Official Presigned URLs

```bash
# Generate presigned URL for download using official share command (valid for 1 hour)
mc share download minio-official/advanced-features/metadata-example.txt --expire=1h

# Generate presigned URL for upload using official share command
mc share upload minio-official/advanced-features/presigned-upload.txt --expire=30m

# Test the presigned download URL (copy the URL from above)
# curl "<presigned-download-url>" -o presigned-download-test.txt
```

### Step 6: Official Object Versioning Simulation

```bash
# Create multiple versions of the same object using official methods
echo "Version 1 content" > versioned-file.txt
mc cp versioned-file.txt minio-official/advanced-features/

echo "Version 2 content - updated" > versioned-file.txt
mc cp versioned-file.txt minio-official/advanced-features/

echo "Version 3 content - final" > versioned-file.txt
mc cp versioned-file.txt minio-official/advanced-features/

# Check current version using official commands
mc cat minio-official/advanced-features/versioned-file.txt
mc stat minio-official/advanced-features/versioned-file.txt
```

### Step 7: Official Batch Operations and Mirroring

```bash
# Create a directory structure for official mirroring
mkdir -p local-data/{documents,images,archives}
echo "Document 1" > local-data/documents/doc1.txt
echo "Document 2" > local-data/documents/doc2.txt
echo "Image metadata" > local-data/images/img1.meta
dd if=/dev/zero of=local-data/archives/archive1.tar bs=1M count=5

# Mirror entire directory structure using official mirror command
mc mirror local-data/ minio-official/advanced-features/mirrored-data/

# Update local files and sync using official method
echo "Updated Document 1" > local-data/documents/doc1.txt
echo "New Document 3" > local-data/documents/doc3.txt

# Sync changes using official mirror (only uploads changed/new files)
mc mirror local-data/ minio-official/advanced-features/mirrored-data/

# List mirrored structure using official commands
mc ls --recursive minio-official/advanced-features/mirrored-data/
```

### Step 8: Official Performance Comparison Tests

```bash
# Test different file sizes and upload methods using official commands
echo "=== Official Performance Testing ==="

# Small files (< 1MB) using official method
for i in {1..5}; do
  dd if=/dev/zero of=small-${i}.dat bs=1K count=100
  time mc cp small-${i}.dat minio-official/advanced-features/perf-test/
done

# Medium files (5-50MB) using official method
for i in {1..3}; do
  dd if=/dev/zero of=medium-${i}.dat bs=1M count=20
  time mc cp medium-${i}.dat minio-official/advanced-features/perf-test/
done

# Large files (>50MB) - observe official multipart upload
dd if=/dev/zero of=large-test.dat bs=1M count=75
time mc cp large-test.dat minio-official/advanced-features/perf-test/

# Parallel uploads using official method
mc cp --recursive local-data/ minio-official/advanced-features/parallel-test/ &

diff large-file.dat downloaded-large-file.dat
echo "Exit code: $?" # Should be 0 for identical files

# Verify all uploaded files using official methods
echo "=== Official Integrity Verification ==="
for file in small-file.txt medium-file.dat large-file.dat; do
  echo "Verifying $file..."
  mc cp minio-official/advanced-features/$file downloaded-$file
  if diff $file downloaded-$file > /dev/null; then
    echo "‚úÖ $file integrity verified"
  else
    echo "‚ùå $file integrity check failed"
  fi
done
```
