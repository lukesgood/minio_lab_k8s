# Module 7: User & Permission Management

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand MinIO's Identity and Access Management (IAM) system
- Create and manage users with different permission levels
- Implement policy-based access control (PBAC)
- Configure bucket-specific permissions
- Test and validate access controls

## üìö Key Concepts

### MinIO IAM System
MinIO implements AWS IAM-compatible identity and access management, providing fine-grained control over who can access what resources and perform which operations.

### Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)
Policies define what actions users can perform on specific resources. MinIO supports both built-in policies and custom policies.

### Principle of Least Privilege
Users should have only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their required tasks.

## üìã Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Explore Current IAM Configuration

```bash
# Check current users (should only show admin)
mc admin user list local

# Check available policies
mc admin policy list local

# Check current user info
mc admin user info local admin
```

**Expected Output:**
```
enabled    admin
```

### Step 2: Create Test Buckets for Permission Testing

```bash
# Create buckets for different access levels
mc mb local/public-data
mc mb local/private-data
mc mb local/shared-data
mc mb local/readonly-data

# Add some test content
echo "Public information" > public-file.txt
echo "Private information" > private-file.txt
echo "Shared information" > shared-file.txt
echo "Read-only information" > readonly-file.txt

mc cp public-file.txt local/public-data/
mc cp private-file.txt local/private-data/
mc cp shared-file.txt local/shared-data/
mc cp readonly-file.txt local/readonly-data/

# List all buckets
mc ls local
```

### Step 3: Create Custom Policies

```bash
# Create a read-only policy
cat << EOF > readonly-policy.json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::readonly-data",
        "arn:aws:s3:::readonly-data/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
EOF

# Create a read-write policy for specific bucket
cat << EOF > readwrite-policy.json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::shared-data",
        "arn:aws:s3:::shared-data/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
EOF

# Create a public read policy
cat << EOF > public-read-policy.json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::public-data",
        "arn:aws:s3:::public-data/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
EOF

# Add policies to MinIO
mc admin policy create local readonly-policy readonly-policy.json
mc admin policy create local readwrite-policy readwrite-policy.json
mc admin policy create local public-read-policy public-read-policy.json

# Verify policies were created
mc admin policy list local
```

### Step 4: Create Users with Different Access Levels

```bash
# Create a read-only user
mc admin user add local readonly-user readonly123

# Create a read-write user
mc admin user add local readwrite-user readwrite123

# Create a public read user
mc admin user add local public-user public123

# List all users
mc admin user list local
```

### Step 5: Assign Policies to Users

```bash
# Assign policies to users
mc admin policy attach local readonly-policy --user readonly-user
mc admin policy attach local readwrite-policy --user readwrite-user
mc admin policy attach local public-read-policy --user public-user

# Verify policy assignments
mc admin user info local readonly-user
mc admin user info local readwrite-user
mc admin user info local public-user
```

### Step 6: Test Read-Only User Permissions

```bash
# Configure mc alias for read-only user
mc alias set readonly http://localhost:9000 readonly-user readonly123

# Test read operations (should work)
echo "Testing read-only user permissions..."
mc ls readonly/readonly-data/
mc cat readonly/readonly-data/readonly-file.txt

# Test write operations (should fail)
echo "Testing write operations (should fail)..."
echo "New content" > test-write.txt
mc cp test-write.txt readonly/readonly-data/new-file.txt 2>&1 || echo "‚úÖ Write correctly denied"

# Test access to other buckets (should fail)
mc ls readonly/private-data/ 2>&1 || echo "‚úÖ Access to private-data correctly denied"
mc ls readonly/shared-data/ 2>&1 || echo "‚úÖ Access to shared-data correctly denied"

rm -f test-write.txt
```

### Step 7: Test Read-Write User Permissions

```bash
# Configure mc alias for read-write user
mc alias set readwrite http://localhost:9000 readwrite-user readwrite123

# Test read operations on allowed bucket
echo "Testing read-write user permissions..."
mc ls readwrite/shared-data/
mc cat readwrite/shared-data/shared-file.txt

# Test write operations on allowed bucket (should work)
echo "New shared content" > shared-new.txt
mc cp shared-new.txt readwrite/shared-data/
mc ls readwrite/shared-data/

# Test delete operations (should work)
mc rm readwrite/shared-data/shared-new.txt
mc ls readwrite/shared-data/

# Test access to other buckets (should fail)
mc ls readwrite/private-data/ 2>&1 || echo "‚úÖ Access to private-data correctly denied"
mc ls readwrite/readonly-data/ 2>&1 || echo "‚úÖ Access to readonly-data correctly denied"

rm -f shared-new.txt
```

### Step 8: Test Public Read User Permissions

```bash
# Configure mc alias for public read user
mc alias set publicread http://localhost:9000 public-user public123

# Test read operations on public bucket
echo "Testing public read user permissions..."
mc ls publicread/public-data/
mc cat publicread/public-data/public-file.txt

# Test write operations (should fail)
echo "Public write test" > public-write.txt
mc cp public-write.txt publicread/public-data/ 2>&1 || echo "‚úÖ Write to public-data correctly denied"

# Test access to other buckets (should fail)
mc ls publicread/private-data/ 2>&1 || echo "‚úÖ Access to private-data correctly denied"
mc ls publicread/shared-data/ 2>&1 || echo "‚úÖ Access to shared-data correctly denied"

rm -f public-write.txt
```

### Step 9: Advanced Policy Testing

```bash
# Create a more complex policy with conditions
cat << EOF > conditional-policy.json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::shared-data/user-uploads/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::shared-data"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "StringLike": {
          "s3:prefix": [
            "user-uploads/*"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
EOF

# Add the conditional policy
mc admin policy create local conditional-policy conditional-policy.json

# Create a user with conditional access
mc admin user add local conditional-user conditional123
mc admin policy attach local conditional-policy --user conditional-user

# Configure alias for conditional user
mc alias set conditional http://localhost:9000 conditional-user conditional123

# Test conditional access
echo "Testing conditional policy..."
mc ls conditional/shared-data/ 2>&1 || echo "‚úÖ Root listing correctly denied"

# Create the allowed directory structure using admin
mc cp shared-file.txt local/shared-data/user-uploads/allowed-file.txt

# Test access to allowed path
mc ls conditional/shared-data/user-uploads/
mc cat conditional/shared-data/user-uploads/allowed-file.txt
```

### Step 10: User Management Operations

```bash
# Disable a user temporarily
mc admin user disable local public-user

# Test that disabled user cannot access
mc ls publicread/public-data/ 2>&1 || echo "‚úÖ Disabled user correctly denied access"

# Re-enable the user
mc admin user enable local public-user

# Test that re-enabled user can access again
mc ls publicread/public-data/ && echo "‚úÖ Re-enabled user can access again"

# Change user password
mc admin user add local readwrite-user newpassword456

# Test with new password
mc alias set readwrite-new http://localhost:9000 readwrite-user newpassword456
mc ls readwrite-new/shared-data/ && echo "‚úÖ New password works"

# Remove policy from user
mc admin policy detach local readwrite-policy --user readwrite-user

# Test that user has no access after policy removal
mc ls readwrite-new/shared-data/ 2>&1 || echo "‚úÖ User correctly has no access after policy removal"

# Re-attach policy
mc admin policy attach local readwrite-policy --user readwrite-user
```

## üîç Understanding IAM Concepts

### Policy Structure

MinIO policies follow AWS IAM policy syntax:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow|Deny",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::bucket/*"],
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "s3:ExistingObjectTag/Department": "Engineering"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Common S3 Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `s3:GetObject` | Download objects |
| `s3:PutObject` | Upload objects |
| `s3:DeleteObject` | Delete objects |
| `s3:ListBucket` | List bucket contents |
| `s3:CreateBucket` | Create new buckets |
| `s3:DeleteBucket` | Delete buckets |
| `s3:GetBucketLocation` | Get bucket region |

### Resource ARN Format

- Bucket: `arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name`
- Object: `arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/object-key`
- Wildcard: `arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*`

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

Before proceeding to Module 8, ensure:

- [ ] Created custom policies for different access levels
- [ ] Successfully created users with different permissions
- [ ] Verified read-only user cannot write or access unauthorized buckets
- [ ] Confirmed read-write user can modify allowed buckets only
- [ ] Tested user enable/disable functionality
- [ ] Validated policy attachment and detachment
- [ ] Understood policy conditions and resource restrictions

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Policy Creation Fails
```bash
# Check JSON syntax
cat policy.json | jq .

# Verify policy format matches MinIO requirements
mc admin policy create local test-policy policy.json
```

### Issue: User Cannot Access Despite Policy
```bash
# Check user status
mc admin user info local username

# Verify policy is attached
mc admin user info local username | grep -i policy

# Check policy content
mc admin policy info local policy-name
```

### Issue: Access Denied Errors
```bash
# Verify credentials are correct
mc alias list

# Check if user is enabled
mc admin user list local

# Verify resource ARNs in policy match actual bucket names
```

### Issue: Policy Not Taking Effect
```bash
# Policies take effect immediately, but check:
# 1. Policy is correctly attached to user
# 2. Resource ARNs are correct
# 3. Actions match what you're trying to do

# Re-attach policy if needed
mc admin policy detach local policy-name --user username
mc admin policy attach local policy-name --user username
```

## üîß Advanced IAM Features (Optional)

### Group Management

```bash
# Create a group (if supported in your MinIO version)
mc admin group add local developers readwrite-user

# Attach policy to group
mc admin policy attach local readwrite-policy --group developers
```

### Service Accounts

```bash
# Create service account for applications
mc admin user svcacct add local readwrite-user

# List service accounts
mc admin user svcacct list local readwrite-user
```

### Temporary Credentials

```bash
# Generate temporary credentials (STS)
mc admin policy create local temp-policy readonly-policy.json
# Note: Full STS implementation may require additional configuration
```

## üìä Security Best Practices

### User Management
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
2. **Regular Audits**: Review user permissions periodically
3. **Strong Passwords**: Enforce password complexity requirements
4. **Account Lifecycle**: Disable unused accounts promptly

### Policy Design
1. **Specific Resources**: Avoid overly broad resource specifications
2. **Explicit Deny**: Use explicit deny for sensitive operations
3. **Conditions**: Use conditions to add additional security layers
4. **Regular Review**: Update policies as requirements change

### Monitoring
1. **Access Logs**: Monitor user access patterns
2. **Failed Attempts**: Track authentication failures
3. **Permission Changes**: Audit policy modifications
4. **Unusual Activity**: Monitor for suspicious behavior
