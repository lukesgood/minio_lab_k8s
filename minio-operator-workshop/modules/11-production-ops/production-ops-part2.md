## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

Ensure you have completed:

- [ ] Capacity monitoring and planning procedures
- [ ] Scaling operations (horizontal and vertical)
- [ ] Automated maintenance procedures
- [ ] Update and upgrade procedures
- [ ] Comprehensive health checks
- [ ] Incident response procedures
- [ ] Operational runbooks created
- [ ] GitOps configuration implemented
- [ ] Performance optimization analysis
- [ ] Disaster recovery automation

## üö® Common Operational Issues

### Issue: Capacity Planning Failures

```bash
# Implement automated capacity alerts
# Set up monitoring for 80% usage threshold
# Plan expansion at 70% usage
```

### Issue: Update Failures

```bash
# Always backup before updates
# Test updates in staging first
# Have rollback procedures ready
# Monitor closely during updates
```

### Issue: Performance Degradation

```bash
# Regular performance baselines
# Monitor resource usage trends
# Implement automated scaling
# Optimize based on usage patterns
```

## üìä Production Operations Best Practices

### Automation
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Use Infrastructure as Code
- Implement CI/CD pipelines
- Self-healing systems

### Monitoring
- Comprehensive observability
- Proactive alerting

- Regular DR tests
- Performance testing
- Security assessments
- Chaos engineering
